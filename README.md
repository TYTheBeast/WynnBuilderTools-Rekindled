# WynnCraft Build Tools

[中文版简介](./doc/zh-CN.md)

## Introduction

This tool is a third-party utility for the Minecraft server [WynnCraft](https://wynncraft.com/), designed to generate build combinations in bulk within the game,
aiming to discover the most suitable builds with optimal attributes.

The current toolkit consists of two main components: the build batch generation tool and the equipment filtering tool.

## Features

- [x] Automatically fetch latest items.json if missing.
- [x] Automatically fetch config.toml if it doesn't exist.
- [x] Traverse and combine builds based on the provided equipment list, identifying valid builds and storing them in a database.
- [x] Set conditions for validity checks, such as minimum attribute requirements, to filter out ineligible builds.
- [x]  Calculate basic attributes (hp, ehp, hpr, elemental defenses, attribute points, mana steal, mana regen, life steal, life regen, walk speed).
- [x] Convert builds into [WynnBuilder](https://hppeng-wynn.github.io/builder) URLs.
- [ ] Additional attribute calculations.
  - [x] dam_pct
  - [x] exp_bonus
  - [ ] cost
- [x] Implement legality checks for Hive equipment.
- [ ] Damage calculations.
  - [ ] Skill calculations.
  - [ ] Tomes calculations.
  - [ ] Powders calculations.
- [x] Equipment filtering tool to extract fitting equipment from all WynnCraft equipment, facilitating the creation of equipment lists.
- [x] Remaining time based on moving average of last ten speeds
- [x] Remaining combinations to process

## Step-by-step Setup Guide (Windows)

1. Download the latest release's artifacts from [the releases page](https://github.com/WynnBuilderTools/WynnBuilderTools/releases)
2. Extract its contents wherever you prefer, but make sure you can easily access the directory in a terminal!
3. You're all set, open a terminal and run the binaries! Remember to make use of the example config.toml, and remember to run `search_item -h` if you're having trouble with the search_item binary!

## Step-by-step Setup Guide (Linux)

1. Download the latest release's artifacts from [the releases page](https://github.com/WynnBuilderTools/WynnBuilderTools/releases)
2. Extract its contents wherever you prefer, but make sure you can easily access the directory in a terminal!
3. You're all set, open a terminal and run the binaries! Remember to make use of the example config.toml, and remember to run `./search_item -h` if you're having trouble with the search_item binary!

## Batch Generation Tool User Guide

The batch generation tool includes a build generator (builder.exe), a configuration file (config.toml) in the config folder, a WynnCraft item data file (items.json) again in the config folder, and a database file (data.db) in the db folder.
The item data file is sourced from [hppeng-wynn](https://github.com/hppeng-wynn/hppeng-wynn.github.io/tree/dev/data).

The final directory structure should look something like this:

binaries/

├── builder.exe

├── migrations/

  │   └── 01_create_builds_table.sql

├── assets/

  │   └── id_map.json

├── config/

  │   ├── config.toml

  │   └── items.json (automatically fetched from v1.0.0 onwards)

└── db/ (automatically generated from v0.5.0 onwards)

  └── data.db (automatically generated from v0.5.0 onwards given a migrations folder at root)

All interactions are handled through the configuration file, as shown below:

```toml
# The configuration file primarily serves two functions:
# 1. Set up the equipment list.
# 2. Define filtering conditions.
# The tool will traverse all possible equipment combinations, check if their attribute points are valid, and store valid builds in the database.
# If the generation process is slow or results in numerous builds with inadequate attributes, filtering conditions can be applied.
#
# The provided example uses RawFish's [Idol build](https://hppeng-wynn.github.io/builder?v=4#8_0Au0K70r50Qr0OK0K20K40OH0Qf160e2I1S0e1g00010039I1004fI18180H0I0I0E0o--hOsKbv3)

Once the configuration file is set up, running the executable program will generate builds. Valid builds will be printed during the process, similar to the following:

```text
helmet:1
chestplate:1
leggings:1
boots:1
bracelet:1
necklace:1
rings:2
total combinations: 3

max_exp_bonus:  0
...
done
```

Generated builds are immediately stored in the database, allowing direct filtering through the database. If you're unfamiliar with databases, you can use [DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S)](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) to browse and filter the results.

## Equipment Filtering Tool User Guide

The equipment filtering tool is a command-line utility designed to filter out equipment with specific attributes that rank high. It can print the results, which can then be copied into the batch generation tool's configuration file.
